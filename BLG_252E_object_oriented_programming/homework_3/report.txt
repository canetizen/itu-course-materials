*) attack() method of the base class Pokemon is redefined in derived classes ElectricPokemon and PsychicPokemon, therefore override (name hiding) is occurred.

*) Attack methods of each derived pokemons take other object as a parameter, this is an example of parameter visibility:

	attack(ElectricPokemon* const); (PsychicPokemon class)
	attack(PsychicPokemon* const); (ElectricPokemon class)


Arena class contains ElectricPokemon and PsychicPokemon pointers of objects, and this is an example of attribute visibility:
 
	ElectricPokemon* elec_current;
	PsychicPokemon* psyc_current;
 
*) The relations between Pokemon-ElectricPokemon and Pokemon-PsychicPokemon are inheritance obviously. ("is a" relation) There is no direct relation between Arena and Pokemon classes. The relations between Arena-PsychicPokemon and Arena-ElectricPokemon must be aggregation. ("has a" relation)
